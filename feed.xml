In this blog post, I’ll share one of my favorite problems I’ve come across lately that is really just inspired by some incredibly simple ideas.</p> <p><b>Problem 1.</b> What is the minimum number of lines \(n\) non-collinear points form if all lines are drawn between points?</p> <p>It is easy to see that we can achieve \(n\) lines by simply leaving \(n - 1\) collinear points on a line and the last point off the line. Indeed, this is the best case possible.</p> <p>To demonstrate why, we can assign variables \(x\) to each of the points, and define a system of equations as:</p> \[\sum_{j: \text{ } x_j \in l_i} x_j = 0.\] <p>That is, the sum of all the variables on line \(i\) is equal to 0. Assuming that there is a placement of \(n\) points that produces less than \(n\) lines, we will have at most \(n - 1\) equations and \(n\) variables, meaning that there exists a nontrivial solution (this is the key idea of the proof). Since the square of non-zero numbers is strictly larger than 0, it would make sense to introduce squares, so let’s square each equation and add them all up, like this:</p> \[\sum_{i = 1}^{m}\left(\sum_{j:\text{ } x_j \in l_i} x_j\right)^2 = \sum_{i = 1}^n a_i x_i^2 + 2\sum_{1 \leq i &lt; j \leq n} a_{i, j} x_i x_j = 0\] <p>where \(m\) is the number of lines, \(a_i\) is the number of lines that \(x_i\) shows up on, and \(a_{i, j}\) is the number of lines \(x_i\) and \(x_j\) show up on. Since our points are not all on a single line, \(a_i &gt; 1\), and since all lines are drawn between points and two points define a line, we have that \(a_{i, j}\) equals exactly 1. Thus,</p> \[0 = \sum_{i = 1}^n a_i x_i^2 + 2\sum_{1 \leq i &lt; j \leq n} a_{i, j} x_i x_j = \sum_{i = 1}^n (a_i - 1) x_i^2 + \left(\sum_{i = 1}^n x_i \right)^2.\] <p>Because we have a non-trivial solution and \(a_i &gt; 1\),</p> \[\sum_{i = 1}^n (a_i - 1) x_i^2 &gt; 0,\] <p>and</p> \[0 = \sum_{i = 1}^n (a_i - 1) x_i^2 + \left(\sum_{i = 1}^n x_i \right)^2 &gt; 0\] <p>gives a contradiction.</p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="math"/><category term="combinatorics"/><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Recently, I’ve been reading more about algebraic methods within combinatorics, and have been fascinated by the appearance of topics like linear algebra in the subject.
