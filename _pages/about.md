I am currently a fourth year undergraduate studying computer science and mathematics at the University of Pennsylvania. I'm interested in reinforcement learning, deep learning, and arithmetic combinatorics. My current focus is on exploring architectures and methods that could enable AI systems to reason more effectively, and on using reinforcement learning as a way to shape adaptive and generalizable behaviors.

During my undergraduate years, I was fortunate to work with mentors and collaborators who shaped my interest in AI. I am particularly grateful to have worked with Professors <a href='https://www.cis.upenn.edu/~mkearns/'> Michael Kearns</a>, <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dan_Roth'> Dan Roth</a>, and <a href='https://rycolab.io/authors/ryan/'> Ryan Cotterell</a>.
