My name is Mike Zhou and I am currently a fourth year undergraduate studying computer science and mathematics at the University of Pennsylvania (UPenn). As a student in Penn's School of Engineering and Applied Science (SEAS), I am interested in deep learning, natural language processing, and arithmetic combinatorics.

I am currently an undergraduate researcher at <a href='https://cogcomp.seas.upenn.edu/'>Penn's Cognitive Computation Group</a>, where I am working with Professor Dan Roth on various aspects of machine translation and language model reasoning. Before that, I worked on the learnability of n-gram models at <a href='https://rycolab.io/'>Rycolab</a>.

My research interests primarily focus on architectures and methods that enable AI systems to reason more effectively. I’m  interested in approaches that reimagine how models structure and manipulate information—such as architectures inspired by latent reasoning spaces—and in reinforcement learning as a tool for shaping adaptive, generalizable behaviors. Alongside this, I study reinforcement learning as a way to guide models toward more adaptive and generalizable behaviors.
