My name is Mike Zhou and I am currently a fourth year undergraduate studying computer science and mathematics at the University of Pennsylvania (UPenn). As a student in Penn's School of Engineering and Applied Science (SEAS), I am interested in deep learning, natural language processing, and arithmetic combinatorics.

I am currently an undergraduate researcher at <a href='https://cogcomp.seas.upenn.edu/'>Penn's Cognitive Computation Group</a>, where I am working with Professor Dan Roth on various aspects of machine translation and language model reasoning. Before that, I worked on the learnability of n-gram models at <a href='https://rycolab.io/'>Rycolab</a>.

Within NLP, I am interested in language model reasoning. I am interested in where models parametrically store their knowledge, and why some prompts (like CoT and self consistency) elicit reasoning better than others. On my free time, I also like to think about problems related to arithmetic combinatorics and graph theory.
